            This section will outline some personal projects Ive worked on.
            I got started with engineering with woodworking (which will be displayed).
            And while it lacks a connection to robotics and aerospace engineering, it taught me a lot.
            Also shown here will be some small mechatronics projects that I did purely
            to teach myself more skills.

                This is a "hovercraft" that is made of pretty rudamentary materials.
                It was made during a pre-college course at Brown University in a class 
                called Fluid Mechanics Through Hovercraft Physics. We had a class wide race 
                on the last day, mine reined undefeated.

                This is a project I did in an early engineering class in highschool.
                Its a CO2 canister powered wooden car race. This picture demonstrates two things.
                The first is the first thing I ever CNC'd, it just so happens that it is hurling at
                the second thing, my phone that is soon to need replacement.

                The other image here shows a rudamentary SCARA arm that I 3D printed
                and used to teach myself some mechatronics and software skills other than 
                those I learned in robotics. This is truly a software project so it will be talked more about in the 
                "code" section.
