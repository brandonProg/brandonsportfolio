            I competed in FIRST robotics all four years of high school.
            I was on FTC team 16391 and FRC team 2383. For those who don't know, FIRST robotics
            is a high school robotics competition aimed at creating and competing
            highly technical and complicated robots. FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) is for younger
            students, the robots are 18x18 inches and played on small fields typically in teams of 
            two. FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) is for older students. The robot's size restrictions
            can change every year but typically the maximum weight is 135 lbs.

                This robot was my FTC robot in the 2021-2022 season. 
                It was my first experience with any kind of real engineering
                and prompted me to delve deeper into the field. From this robot
                I learned design principles, basic manufacturing, 3d printing for structural purposes, and much more.
                I owe this robot alot, not only did I get to play a large 
                part in the design and creation of it, but I was its driver.
                Much of my FRC career and future projects are built on the knowledge I 
                began learning with this robot.

                    The first of three FRC robots I was responsible for building was for the 2023 Charged Up season. 
                    This I was least responsible for as I was a junior and this year 
                    our mechanical department was oversaturated. However, I took this opportunity
                    to over-design the parts I was responsible for and ended up being solely in charge
                    of manufacturing the robot. I took this chance to learn more for myself and began
                    teaching my underclassmen so I could rely on them in my senior year. I also served on
                    the drive team for this robot and developed my repair skills in a time-sensitive scenario.
                    This year our team also tried to develop differential swerve, a very unexplored area of
                    FRC drivetrains where two motors run a differential gearbox with an inner gear stack
                    to mimic a coaxial swerve drive train but have a higher torque in a straight line.

                The robot seen here is our off-season robot for the same game as the previous season. 
                By this point, I was a senior director of the team in charge of robot design and build.
                The goal of the off-season is to replay the season's game and outdo ourselves. We started late 
                and had very little time before the first off-season competition. On top of this, my co-director and 
                I had never designed a robot alone before. We won both off-season competitions we went to.
                This prepared me most for my senior season as I not only designed and built this robot but was its driver 
                and lead pit member. With this understanding of the intricacies of how a robot works, and the experience 
                of working in a team-based, stressful environment, I went on to design better robots and extensively overhaul 
                our team's design process with the help of my co-director.

                This robot was our team's robot for the 2024 Crescendo season. By
                this point, I was the mechanical director of the robot and the pit 
                captain and technician at each competition. This season, we made the most 
                iterations of robots in any season our team has competed in. The first iteration 
                (a massive failure) can be seen in the third image below (a cad). This 
                season the biggest lesson I learned is designing for controllability. I learned more 
                about the software on the robot and how we can build better for controllability. 
                I also did the most teaching I've done, running workshops for the underclassmen 
                and delegating work to them to make as many iterations as we did.
