            This requires some background. I am NOT a software-inclined person, nor have I ever been.
            I was always fascinated by the other side of engineering but never understood it. And it is 
            daunting. All of the code I have learned has been to elevate my other skills. It has expanded 
            the projects I can do, elevated my communication with peers, and made me a more efficient engineer.
            And while this all sounds amazing, by all means, my code is rudimentary.

            I started coding really with scratch in school. However, that lacks much industry application 
            nowadays. So really I began my coding journey with web development. I learned HTML, CSS, and JS
            from an open-source code-learning website called The Odin Project. It taught me beginner skills,
            just enough to satisfy my urge to know how the websites I browsed were made. The skills I learned
            proved helpful, especially in making this portfolio.

                After I deemed myself proficient enough in web development I began to learn Python.
                I did all the basic challenges, learned beginner algorithms, and explored necessary libraries 
                before moving on to discover the real fun of Python which are the supplementary libraries that make it so powerful
                 like Selenium, Streamlit, Pygame, and more. In the future I hope to keep exploring the libraries that 
                 make Python as powerful as it is and learn more advanced topics like machine learning.

                This is my first coding challenge. I created an HTML local-host webpage with 
                just a box on it that was coded so wherever I moved my mouse on the box,
                 the arm I built would follow. From this, I learned 
                Flask, inverse kinematics, Arduino, Raspberry Pi (a mistake on my journey), and many 
                algorithms. I learned a lot from this project and had a great time doing it.

                This was my next, and most recent project. It's a Pong game made with Pygame, the motivation 
                for this creation was essentially, to see if I could. Turns out, it was pretty simple. One flaw, the robot is unbeatable.
